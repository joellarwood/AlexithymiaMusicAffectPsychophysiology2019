This site provides a version controlled and computationally reproducible record of analysis for *Facial and Electrodermal responses to music across alexithymia*

You can navigate to pages describing each step of the anbalysis (except for the psychophysiology pre-processing) using the top bar. 

The data can be accessed in this [folder](https://github.com/joellarwood/AlexithymiaMusicAffectPsychophysiology2019/tree/master/analysis/data) on the project [repository](https://github.com/joellarwood/AlexithymiaMusicAffectPsychophysiology2019). You can also se archives of my work on this project data to early 2019 in this [folder](https://github.com/joellarwood/AlexithymiaMusicAffectPsychophysiology2019/tree/master/Archives)
