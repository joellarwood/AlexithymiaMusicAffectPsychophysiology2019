Confirmatory Predictions
------------------------

<!-- Describe the (numbered) hypotheses in terms of directional relationships between your (manipulated or measured) variables. For interaction effects, describe the expected shape of the interactions. If you are manipulating a variable, make predictions for successful check variables or explain why no manipulation check is included. -->
### Psychophysiology

<p>
**H1:** Music that is negatively valenced will lead to increased
corrugator activity compared to music that is positively valenced.

``` r
##Insert hypothesis test code chunk/s
```

</p>
<p>
**H2:** Music that is posititvely valenced will lead to increased
zygomaticus activity compared to music that is negatively valenced.

``` r
##Insert hypothesis test code chunk/s
```

</p>
**H3:** Music that is high in arousal will lead to increased skin
conductance <!--Check specifics with Eric. --> compared to music that is
low in arousal.

``` r
##Insert hypothesis test code chunk/s
```

</p>
<p>
**H4:** Alexithymia will not moderate any relationships between musical
valence or arousal and psychophysiology.

``` r
##Insert hypothesis test code chunk/s
```

</p>
### Core Affect

<p>
**H5:** Alexithymia will moderate judgements of experienced valence and
arousal such that
<blockquote>
<p>
***A:*** People high in alexithymia will judge their experience of
valence as more neutral for negative but not positively valenced music.

``` r
##Insert hypothesis test code chunk
```

</p>
<p>
***B:*** People high in alexithymia will have judge thier experience of
arousal as more neutral when the music is positively valenced but not
when it is negatively valenced

``` r
##Insert hypothesis test code chunk
```

</p>
</blockquote>
### Emotion Differentiation

**H6:** High alexithymia will predict reduced differentiation between
negative emotions but not between positive emotions.

``` r
##Insert hypothesis test code chunk
```

Explorations
------------

<p>
**E1** Does the shift from the mean value of valence and arousal
(Zscore) predict the extent to which an emotion\[^1\] was judged as
being as experienced. \[^1\]: The emotion will be whatever emotion was
the highest rated for that musical peice and will be opoerationalised as
Zscore.
</p>
<p>
**E2** Is psychophysiology over time predicted by musical
characteristics over time\[^2\] \[^2\]: This will likely need to be done
by extracting musical features over time using a python MIR toolbox and
correlating with raw acqknowledge files.

Rationale (optional)
--------------------

<!-- A figure or table may be helpful to describe complex interactions; this facilitates correct specification of the ordering of all group means. For original research, add rationales or theoretical frameworks for why a certain hypothesis is tested. If multiple predictions can be made for the same IV-DV combination, describe what outcome would be predicted by which theory. -->

Methods
=======

Design
------

<!-- List, based on your hypotheses from the hypotheses section A, independent variables with all their levels
    a) whether they are within- or between-participant
    b) the relationship between them (e.g., orthogonal, nested).

List dependent variables, or variables in a correlational design and variables acting as covariates or moderators. -->

Planned sample
--------------

<!-- If applicable, describe pre-selection rules. Indicate where, from whom and how the data will be collected. Justify planned sample size. If applicable, include or refer to a file related to your power analysis here (e.g., a protocol of power analyses from G*Power, a script, a screenshot, etc.). Describe data collection termination rule. -->
Enter your response here.

Exclusion criteria
------------------

<!-- Describe anticipated specific data exclusion criteria. For example:
    a) missing, erroneous, or overly consistent responses;
    b) failing check-tests or suspicion probes;
    c) demographic exclusions;
    d) data-based outlier criteria;
    e) method-based outlier criteria (e.g. too short or long response times). -->
Enter your response here.

Procedure
---------

<!-- Describe all manipulations, measures, materials and procedures including the order of presentation and the method of randomization and blinding (e.g., single or double blind), as in a published Methods section. -->
<!-- Optional: Set fail-safe levels of exclusion at which the whole study needs to be stopped, altered, and restarted. You may pre-determine what proportion of excluded participants will cause the study to be stopped and restarted. If applicable, you can refer to any files related to your methods and procedure here (e.g., a paper describing a scale you are using, experimenter instructions, etc.) -->
Enter your response here.

Analysis plan
=============

Confirmatory analyses
---------------------

<!-- Describe the analyses that will test the predictions from the hypotheses section A. Include: 
    a) the relevant variables and how they are calculated
    b) the statistical technique
    c) each variableâ€™s role in the technique (e.g., IV, DV, moderator, mediator, covariate)
    d) rationale for each covariate used, if any.

If using techniques other than null hypothesis testing (for example, Bayesian statistics), describe your criteria and inputs toward making an evidential conclusion, including prior values or distributions. -->
Enter your response here.

Details of analysis
-------------------

<!-- Specify contingencies and assumptions, such as: 
    a) Method of correction for multiple tests
    b) The method of missing data handling (e.g., pairwise or listwise deletion, imputation, interpolation)
    c) Reliability criteria for item inclusion in scale
    d) Anticipated data transformations
    e) Assumptions of analyses, and plans for alternative/corrected analyses if each assumption is violated
    f) If applicable, you can refer to any files here that are related to your analyses (e.g., syntaxes, scripts, etc.). -->
