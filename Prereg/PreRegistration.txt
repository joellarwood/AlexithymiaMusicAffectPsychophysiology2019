# Hypotheses
















## Confirmatory Predictions 
<!-- Describe the (numbered) hypotheses in terms of directional relationships between your (manipulated or measured) variables. For interaction effects, describe the expected shape of the interactions. If you are manipulating a variable, make predictions for successful check variables or explain why no manipulation check is included. -->
















### Psychophysiology
<p> **H1:** Music that is negatively valenced will lead to increased corrugator activity compared to music that is positively valenced. 
```{r}
##Insert hypothesis test code chunk/s
```
</p>
<p> **H2:** Music that is posititvely valenced will lead to increased zygomaticus activity compared to music that is negatively valenced. 
```{r}
##Insert hypothesis test code chunk/s
```
</p>
**H3:** Music that is high in arousal will lead to increased skin conductance <!--Check specifics with Eric. --> compared to music that is low in arousal. 
```{r}
##Insert hypothesis test code chunk/s
```
</p>
<p>**H4:** Alexithymia will not moderate any relationships between musical valence or arousal and psychophysiology. 
```{r}
##Insert hypothesis test code chunk/s
```
</p>
### Core Affect
<p>**H5:** Alexithymia will moderate judgements of experienced valence and arousal such that 
  <blockquote><p> _**A:**_ People high in alexithymia will judge their experience of valence as more neutral for negative but not positively valenced music.
```{r}
##Insert hypothesis test code chunk
```
</p> 
<p> _**B:**_ People high in alexithymia will have judge thier experience of arousal as more neutral when the music is positively valenced but not when it is negatively valenced
```{r}
##Insert hypothesis test code chunk
```
  </p>
  </blockquote>
















### Emotion Differentiation 
**H6:** High alexithymia will predict reduced differentiation between negative emotions but not between positive emotions. 
```{r}
##Insert hypothesis test code chunk
```
















## Explorations
<p>**E1** Does the shift from the mean value of valence and arousal (Zscore) predict the extent to which an emotion^[1] was judged as being as experienced. 
^[1]: The emotion will be whatever emotion was the highest rated for that musical peice and will be opoerationalised as Zscore.</p>
















<p>**E2** Is psychophysiology over time predicted by musical characteristics over time[^2]
[^2]: This will likely need to be done by extracting musical features over time using a python MIR toolbox and correlating with raw acqknowledge files. 
















## Rationale (optional)
<!-- A figure or table may be helpful to describe complex interactions; this facilitates correct specification of the ordering of all group means. For original research, add rationales or theoretical frameworks for why a certain hypothesis is tested. If multiple predictions can be made for the same IV-DV combination, describe what outcome would be predicted by which theory. -->
















<p>There are two dominant perspectives that explain emotional experiences; the basic emotion approach and the constructed emotion approach. These perspectives lead to fundamentally different hypotheses about the antecedents and processes of emotional experience. While both theories of emotion arrive at the same end product of an emotion category, basic emotion theory does not consider valence and arousal while constructionist theory does. Furthermore, basic emotion theory has a strong stimulus -> response link. Constructed emotion provides a more nuanced view, however, where the affective qualities of a stimuli are considered, along with situational goals and changes in bodily state with these considerations being used to predict which emotion, conceptually grouped by language, is likely being experienced. Thefefore basic emotion theory places an emphasis on emotional fingerprints, or distinct physiology for dfinstinct emotions, while constructivist theory does not. </p>
















<p>Language is central to constructivist approaches, whereby emotion words group knowledge about emotions and their context specific phenotypes. Alexithymia is charactersied by a lack of words for emotions and is considered to contribute to a difficulty in emotional experience and differentiation. Alexithymia, therefore, provides insight into the biocognition of emotional experience.</p> 
















<p>Given the documented difficulties in emotional experience in alexithymia a basic emotion theory leads to the hypothesis that there will be physiological differences in high and low alexithymics during emotional stimulus presentation. Conversely, constructivist theory does not make this prediction of a moderation but does allow for physiological differences when the stimuli are prototypical and emotionally relevant (as is the case with music). </p>
















<p> Regardless of theory alexithymia will also be related to difficulties in the rating of emotional experience. Given music is seen as being primarily dimensional with emotions constructed around affective judgements the difficulties in emotional experience in alexithymia should be observed at an affective level as well as a categorical level. Poor concept emotion concept definition in alexithymia also leads to the prediction that the differentiation between emotions will be hampered. According to constructivist theory this is due to a lack of orthogonal concepts, while basic theory will relate this to experienced physiology during the emotional experience whereby differnt emotions will have distinct physiological patterning. </p>  
















# Methods
















## Design
<!-- List, based on your hypotheses from the hypotheses section A, independent variables with all their levels
    a) whether they are within- or between-participant
    b) the relationship between them (e.g., orthogonal, nested).
















List dependent variables, or variables in a correlational design and variables acting as covariates or moderators. -->

## Planned sample
<!-- If applicable, describe pre-selection rules. Indicate where, from whom and how the data will be collected. Justify planned sample size. If applicable, include or refer to a file related to your power analysis here (e.g., a protocol of power analyses from G*Power, a script, a screenshot, etc.). Describe data collection termination rule. -->
















The sample will be 120 undergraduate psychology students. 
















## Exclusion criteria
<!-- Describe anticipated specific data exclusion criteria. For example:
    a) missing, erroneous, or overly consistent responses;
    b) failing check-tests or suspicion probes;
    c) demographic exclusions;
    d) data-based outlier criteria;
    e) method-based outlier criteria (e.g. too short or long response times). -->
















## Procedure
<!-- Describe all manipulations, measures, materials and procedures including the order of presentation and the method of randomization and blinding (e.g., single or double blind), as in a published Methods section. -->
















<!-- Optional: Set fail-safe levels of exclusion at which the whole study needs to be stopped, altered, and restarted. You may pre-determine what proportion of excluded participants will cause the study to be stopped and restarted. If applicable, you can refer to any files related to your methods and procedure here (e.g., a paper describing a scale you are using, experimenter instructions, etc.) -->
















# Analysis plan
































## Confirmatory analyses 
<!-- Describe the analyses that will test the predictions from the hypotheses section A. Include: 
    a) the relevant variables and how they are calculated
    b) the statistical technique
    c) each variable’s role in the technique (e.g., IV, DV, moderator, mediator, covariate)
    d) rationale for each covariate used, if any.
















If using techniques other than null hypothesis testing (for example, Bayesian statistics), describe your criteria and inputs toward making an evidential conclusion, including prior values or distributions. -->
















All analyses relating to differences in affect and emotion across music type and alexithymia will be modelled using a HGLMM. Trials for each stimuli will be nested in the stimulus which is nested in the affective category. Alexithymia will be treated as a continuous variable and the model will be the emotion category*alexithymia interaction, grouped by participant, stimulus and trial. 
## Details of analysis
<!-- Specify contingencies and assumptions, such as: 
    a) Method of correction for multiple tests
    b) The method of missing data handling (e.g., pairwise or listwise deletion, imputation, interpolation)
    c) Reliability criteria for item inclusion in scale
    d) Anticipated data transformations
    e) Assumptions of analyses, and plans for alternative/corrected analyses if each assumption is violated
    f) If applicable, you can refer to any files here that are related to your analyses (e.g., syntaxes, scripts, etc.). -->

## Project schedule (optional)
<!-- Provide the (estimated) start and end dates for this project. -->
















Data will be collected up until the 2nd June, at which point this data will be analysed for presentation at the 2019 ISRE conference. It is anticipated that 80 data points will be available at this time (120 participant slots are open). Data collection will resume in August and continue until the sample of 120 has been reached. Data will only be analysed at 2 points: Between June 2 and August (when recruitment is paused) and at the completion of the sampling of 120 participants.
